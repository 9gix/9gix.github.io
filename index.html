        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I love computer graphics on the web. I have been dealing with
          web technology since 2013 and with computer graphics since 2015.
          Both technologies are very interesting,
          they married happily under my watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, I enjoy being a system cracker.
          It is always fun to hack something.
          I even took a Security specialization in Republic Polytechnic.
          However, learning security is not about doing bad stuff.
          It is about prevention and mitigation incidents.
