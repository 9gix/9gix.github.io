        If you encounter any issue on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/764592/yeo?tab=tags">relevant topic</a>, you can ask me directly. 
        I prefer you can send me your question directly via email.
        I will try my best to help you, or at least get back to you when I'm could.
      </p>

        Alternatively you can ask the online Q&A (Stackoverflow, Quora, etc...) and send me the link to your question.
        I don't really recommend new comer to ask question in Stackoverflow without some research.
        Bad question will be downvoted very badly by the community. The community is hostile.
        If you don't know how to ask or you think it is a stupid question, then you can drop me an email first, at least I will try to help you.
        If I can't help you, and I believed your question is worth asking, I will recommend you to post in the community and I will try to help you there.
      </p>
